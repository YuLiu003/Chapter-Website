Created by Mary Delos Reyes [SIG Design Lead] - [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/R63olIJGYgI6c0Exjelpze/Light-Mode-ACM)

## Getting Started
Look in the [issues](https://github.com/UCMercedACM/Chapter-Website/issues) tab of this repository and look for an issue you'd like to work on
(make sure the nobody else is working on the issue unless you want to work with another person) and make a pull request along with that issue.
Don't know how to do this? keep on reading below.

## Quick Setup
Make sure you have the following:  
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) .... p.s. **v12.19.0** is a safe option, but really recommended to install [**nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)   
Run "npm i" then "npm start" (You will need your own Firebase Key, if you need the main key contact Sal#1867 or nayr#8772 on discord)

## New to coding?
If you don’t have much experience with JavaScript (which we will use for the backend) you can look into 
working on front end (which is easier to learn) the front-end is in the languages html and css so you can 
first start by learning html and css and to learn these 2 languages I’d recommend watching this video: https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc

## Committing/Running the development server for beginners
### Questions? Contact Sal#1867 or nayr#8772 on discord
* Fork this repository
(If you're not planning on committing to the repository you can just clone the main repo and skip the next step (including this one))
  * How to fork:
    * click on “Fork” on the top right
* Then git clone that repository you just forked to your computer
  * How to clone:
    * Go to your terminal
    * CD into your desired location to clone the repository
    * Type in the command “git clone [link to your forked repository]” and press enter
      * e.g: “git clone https://github.com/ryanlee68/Chapter-Website”
* CD into that clone you just made
* Make sure you're in the react branch (Most likely you'll be in the right branch)
  * How to make sure you're in the right branch:
    *Type in "git branch -a" and make sure the asterisk * is right next to "react"
  * How to switch branches:
    * First, make sure that you're CD'd into the forked repository
    * Use the command “git checkout origin/react” in your terminal and press enter
* CD into .\react\acm-chapter-website\
* Then, type in “npm i” in terminal and press enter
  * If issues with vulnerabilities with packages
  * Use "npm audit fix", and not "npm audit fix --force" as it causes functions to not exist anymore or have a different behaviour effectively breaking         applications 
* About Firebase
  * You will need a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) key to run the server and connect to the database
    * There are two options to go about this
      * You can either make your own [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) instance and use your own key
      * Or you can contact Sal#1867 or nayr#8772 on discord to get ACM's firebase key
* Run the development website/server
  * How to run the development server:
    * Type in "npm start" in your terminal and press enter
      * Again, make sure you're in the correct folder (forked-repository\react\acm-chapter-website\)
* **Code!**
* If you've fixed a particular issue then your last commit’s comment to this forked repository should include fixed and the issue number e.g: “fixed #123”
* Make a pull request to the main repository https://github.com/UCMercedACM/Chapter-Website/pulls
